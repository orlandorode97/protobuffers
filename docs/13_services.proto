/*
  Services
  We can define a message type that uses an RPC system (Remote Procedure Call), this is where a service
  comes from.
  A service is an interface that defines zero o more RPC calls.
  The procotol buffer compiler generates a service interface code and stubs (generated code client to implement) in the chosen
  programming languages.

  We define a servie with the keyword service and the follow the name of the service.
  Then define the rpc methods with the keyword rpc followed by the rpc name, and the request and return response.
*/

// Define SearchService
service SearchService {
  // Define Search RPC method by receiving a SearchRequest and return a SearchResponse
  rpc Search(SearchRequest) returns (SearchResponse);
}

// SearchRequest
message SearchRequest {
  string query = 1;
  int32 current_page = 2;
}

// SearchResponse
message SearchResponse {
  int32 total = 1;
  message Meta {
    string next = 1;
  }
}

// The most compatible RPC system is gRPC which is an open-source RPC system developed by google.
