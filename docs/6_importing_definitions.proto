  For complex message types it recommendable to split the messages in multiple files.
  Let's suppose we have a message type Car in the location `protobuffers/docs/car/car.proto`
  and we want to use it in another proto file to embed another message type.
  In order to achieve this we have to import the proto file in other to get acess to the Car message.
  We import `import "protobuffers/docs/car/car.proto"` at the top of the file.
