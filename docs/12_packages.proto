/*
  Packages
  You can add an optional `package` identifier to avoid name collisions with other protocol messages types
  with the purpose to organize and structure all your proto files.
  We define a package with the keyword `package` and then the name of the package.
  package example;
  This is similar when importing protos but this will be from the package perspective and an easy way to import.

// Examples in docs/packages

// The generated code based on packages depends on the chosen programming language:
// For Golang the keyword `package` is ignored and the `.pb.go` files are generated in the
// option go_package ="name/package"

// The keyword `package` is ignored by most of the programming languages but it is recomendable to specify it in .proto files
